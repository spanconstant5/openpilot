# TSS3 port audit

First audit 2026-09-21; rewritten 2026-10-09 against the current tree (openpilot `cb31aedfe`, opendbc `9bdacdd74`, panda `92eb56516`). Static review, unit tests, and CI-path analysis only — no hardware, live CAN, or road validation, and nothing here certifies actuation safety.

## Verdict

The substantive port is sound and stays: vehicle decoding (`carstate.py`), radar track assembly (`radar_interface.py`), the TSS3 DBCs, independent safety enforcement (`safety/modes/toyota.h`), and standard controller integration. The original audit's worst findings are fixed: panda carries **zero** fork changes (the sample-point and BRS experiments were reverted; the pin is commaai master), the personality-synchronization policy is gone, the redundant radar path is consolidated, and topology is one definition — `ToyotaTSS3PlatformConfig`, toyota_b repin, chassis/state bus 0, FRC bus 2 — covering Camry and Crown. Corolla was deleted wholesale.

Two things are actually open:

1. **Crown has no validation route.** `TOYOTA_CROWN_TSS3` is registered (`values.py:251`) but has neither a route in `tests/routes.py` nor an exemption, so `test_models.py:169` raises `missing test route` and CI (`tests.yml:116`) fails. Beyond that, every TSS3 platform skips the controls tests (`test_models.py:293` — commands are built from live CAN and signer responses), so no TSS3 platform has recorded-route coverage of control generation; Camry's single route (`routes.py:240`) exercises decoding only. `docs/CARS.md` was regenerated for Camry but not Crown.
2. **Bringup automation ships inside the vehicle port.** ~1,650 changed lines across pandad lifecycle changes (`pandad.cc` +330/−13, `tss3_startup_catcher.h`), the oracle daemon and UI (`toyota_tss3_oracle_auto.py`, `tss3_oracle.py`), its tests, and manager registration. It arms on the TSS3 safety bit for any TSS3-flagged platform, and its signer tool lives at `/data/tss3-oracle/tss3-request-signer` (`toyota_tss3_oracle_auto.py:19`) — outside the git pins, so a checkout does not describe the working system. It is tested (19 passed) but is development tooling, not vehicle support.

Native startup pre-arm disables automatic CAN-FD promotion on all three Panda buses, matching normal TSS3 safety. This keeps explicitly Classical diagnostic packets Classical after FD wake traffic. The policy is preloaded while OFF, outside the ignition hot path.

Initial ELM327 firmware fingerprinting also disables automatic CAN-FD promotion on all three buses, matching Python Panda diagnostics. On the live Camry, automatic promotion allowed only ABS to answer; disabling it on the same bus 0 restored EPS, camera, and ABS Tester Present/F181 responses. Post-identification frame policy and strict firmware matching are unchanged.

At the 2026-10-09 audit, both forks lagged commaai master. The parent rebase and opendbc pin update are recorded under Validation below; the inventory remains the historical audit snapshot.

## In-repo signer boundary

`tss3.py` signs CONTROL_REQUEST (0x08A) through the **EPS-resident SecOC signer** over CAN — not the external oracle tool. Now 167 lines (down from 331) with a transport-shaped API — `receive` / `request_due` / `send` — and an in-file timing contract: 17–32 ms signer latency hidden by four pending requests, 90 ms response timeout, 100 ms CONTROL_REQUEST gap before the VMC latches a fault. The controller's only coupling is gating rate-limit advance on `request_due` (`carcontroller.py:103`), so driving intent stays in CarController and enforcement stays in safety. Do not merge this into `car/secoc.py`; the upstream helper is keyed authentication with different availability and lifecycle semantics.

Remaining gap: no deterministic offline double drives this boundary, which is why the model suite skips TSS3 controls tests.

## Ownership

| Owner | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Upstream openpilot | Engagement, driver interaction policy, planning, longitudinal/lateral control, personality |
| opendbc Toyota interface/state/radar | Identify supported configuration; decode vehicle observations; expose standard CarParams, CarState, RadarData |
| opendbc Toyota controller | Translate standard CarControl into vehicle commands using existing limiting helpers |
| `tss3.py` SignerTransport | Represent the EPS signer exchange and its availability; no driving policy |
| opendbc safety | Independently restrict actuation and forwarding, with bounded failure behavior |
| panda | Unmodified upstream transport |
| Bringup (to be split out) | Prepare and inspect the development environment through a separately maintained lifecycle |

## Remaining work

1. Register a Crown route or exempt it deliberately — CI is red on `test_models` until then. Recover capture provenance: the deleted audit fixtures' `manifest.json` was the only record, and the Camry route's comment says only "openpilot longitudinal". Build a deterministic signer double and un-skip the TSS3 controls tests against it. Regenerate `CARS.md`.
2. Split bringup into its own review series: pandad startup/lifecycle, oracle daemon + UI, and external tool versioning. Until then it travels with every port change and vice versa.
3. Parent update completed 2026-10-13 onto `42ccc5ceb`; opendbc now uses the updated `tss3-expand` branch at `9de3b22d`.

## Validation

Run 2026-10-09 with `opendbc_repo/.venv`:

- opendbc Toyota suites (`car/toyota/tests/`, `safety/tests/test_toyota.py`): **318 passed, 124 skipped, 272 subtests passed**. Skips are pre-existing platform/SecOC skips plus the TSS3 controls skip above.
- Parent TSS3 suites (`pandad/tests/test_direct_panda_lease.py`, `car/tests/test_toyota_tss3_oracle_*.py`): **19 passed, 22 subtests passed**.
- Previously recorded (2026-09): five recorded-route checks passed against the Camry capture; Toyota safety suites pass with their existing skips.
- Not run: full CI, MISRA coverage, hardware builds, live CAN, road tests.

### 2026-10-13 rebase verification

- Replayed the parent port onto commaai master `42ccc5ceb`, preserving both upstream navigation settings and the TSS3 controls in the mici developer page.
- Pinned opendbc `tss3-expand` at `9de3b22d`, including the upstream car-mass removal and the Camry, Crown, and Corolla TSS3 definitions.
- Rebuilt `openpilot/common/libparams_c.dylib` for the updated parameter keys.
- Parent oracle suites: **16 tests passed** under unittest. Panda lease suite: **3 standalone test functions passed** under `unittest.FunctionTestCase`.
- Desktop smoke: rendered and visually checked navigation and TSS3 bringup controls; confirmed TSS3 eligibility for Camry, Crown, and Corolla. The external signer kit was absent, and the UI displayed `KIT MISSING`.
- LFS downloads were skipped during rebase; this does not fix Hugging Face authentication. Full builds, Toyota safety suites, hardware, and road behavior were not validated in this update.

### 2026-10-21 rebase test repair

- Lease lifecycle tests now use `unittest.TestCase` so `tools/test_runner.py` discovers all three scenarios.

### 2026-10-22 CONTROL_REQUEST checksum and PCS correction

- `CONTROL_REQUEST` byte 7 is the Toyota checksum over the first eight bytes. CarState and panda detect PCS from `PCS_BRAKE_REQUEST` (byte 4, mask `0x40`); the checksum-derived request IDs are removed. Panda validates the checksum before approving signer requests in both longitudinal modes.
- Replayed `00000043--29caa20fbc--12` through CarInterface and compiled panda safety: all 21 recorded PCS frames were detected and forwarded after RX, with normal control restored afterward. All 1,662,572 readable incoming `CONTROL_REQUEST` frames in the retained logs passed the checksum; LogReader reported corrupted events in the corpus.
- Toyota car/safety and CAN suites: **370 passed, 40 skipped** under unittest. MISRA, Ruff, codespell, and C lint passed. All **22 mutations** of the changed Toyota safety logic were killed.

### 2026-11-01 Corolla clean-baseline stationary capture

- Capture `20261101T201200-1690-35111683423` was produced by a clean checkout
  of openpilot `80b8615c39`, opendbc `d8a50afdbe`, and upstream panda
  `f38f504ffa`; `initData.dirty` was false. The signed Panda firmware on the
  device matched the checkout.
- The external kit matched Corolla EPS F181
  `8965F1208000 / 8A3111213000`, installed payload
  `6234bb5bd496a82fabb32c27b56b3db0f1907b5bf6482e4c19f8835153ff69fc`,
  and received one status-zero `0x7A9` response to its four-frame `0x777`
  probe in 68.691 ms. All four installer transmissions were accepted and none
  were rejected.
- The route stayed stationary and CAN-valid for 39.265 seconds, but exact
  firmware matching returned `MOCK`. Panda therefore remained in ELM327 safety
  and runtime signer probing never started; this capture does not test signer
  residency past eight seconds or the Toyota safety transition.
- The car reported engine `8A2221221000`, ABS `F152612D1700`, EPS
  `8965F1208000 / 8A3111213000`, radar `8821F4801200`, and camera
  `8646F210200`. The engine, ABS, and radar variants are now added to the
  Corolla exact-match set alongside the existing EPS entry; the camera's
  nonstandard 11-character response can remain an extra ECU
  because exact matching succeeds without making it a fuzzy-match authority.
- No host `0x08A` was published. The mirrored native `0x08A` carried equal
  upper/lower OEM acceleration fields from -0.178 to -0.169 m/s². The
  persisted `AlphaLongitudinalEnabled` parameter was `1`; it must be disabled
  before the next stationary run so the first recognized Corolla test remains
  in stock-longitudinal mode.
